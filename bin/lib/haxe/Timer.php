/**
 * The `Timer` class allows you to create asynchronous timers on platforms that
 * support events.
 * The intended usage is to create an instance of the `Timer` class with a given
 * interval, set its `run()` method to a custom function to be invoked and
 * eventually call `stop()` to stop the `Timer`.
 * Note that a running `Timer` may or may not prevent the program to exit
 * automatically when `main()` returns.
 * It is also possible to extend this class and override its `run()` method in
 * the child class.
 * Notice for threaded targets:
 * `Timer` instances require threads they were created in to run with Haxe's event loops.
 * Main thread of a Haxe program always contains an event loop. For other cases use
 * `sys.thread.Thread.createWithEventLoop` and `sys.thread.Thread.runWithEventLoop` methods.
